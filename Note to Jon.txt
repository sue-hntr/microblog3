Hi Jon
Hopefully I don't disturb your fast and I can wish you a Happy New Year when you read this.
I am at an impasse with the microblog again. My ruby language tags are not showing up on my views.
In particular the "profiles.erb". Could you look at my code which I've pushed to GitHub
at https://github.com/sue-hntr/microblog3 and tell me what to put to make the username show up.
As you can see on the page, no options on the app.rb for profile show up.
Stephanie advised @user.username (copy of message:Sue, I would advise: in the post action: @user = User.find(session[:user_id])
erb :profile. I wouldn't name your path /user (singular) because it will conflict with the /users (plural) path and the :user (foreign key). Then in the erb file: <%= @user.username %> <br> <%= @user.password %>)
